# 3D Audio For Museum Exhibits
3D audio is being utilized within museums and cultural spaces to deliver aural guides and a heightened level of immersion for museum goers, aesthetes, and the general population that visit the enhanced exhibits. Numerous implementations of this technology exist internationally; however, one instance of a model at the University of Florida is constantly being maintained, upgraded, and tested in order to produce a unique museum experience. The current implementation of this system has future goals, challenges, and plans to resolve any potential issues regarding the 3D audio systemâ€™s development.
